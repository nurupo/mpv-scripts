# mpv config files and scripts
Some scripts and config files I use, perhaps someone finds them useful.

See also [`mpv-url-opener`](https://github.com/nurupo/mpv-url-opener) - a small https server that listens for requests to open YouTube URLs in mpv.

## Description
Each script contains a short description.

Some scripts are x11-specific, i.e. might not work on Wayland, at least not without modification.

## License
Scripts have various licenses.
You can find a license blurb inside each script.
