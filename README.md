# mpv config files and scripts
Some scripts and config files I use, perhaps someone finds them useful.

## Description
Each script contains a short description.

Some scripts are x11-specific, i.e. might not work on Wayland, at least not without modification.

## License
Scripts have various licenses.
You can find a license blurb inside each script.
